# NLPC
A project made as a part of our C Programming course at PES University that attempts to recreate Python's Natural Language Processing library - nltk, for the C programming language. The project is an ongoing one and currently includes the Lancaster Stemmer, Word vectorizers, lemmatisers and other text preprocessing metrics.
